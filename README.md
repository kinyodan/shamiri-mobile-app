* CD into the cloned repository folder
* Run below commands

## Backend Api

### Dependencies

* Python version used Python 3.10.12 but should not be a problem with most python distributions.
* Framework used FastApi (a python based framework) version details (FastAPI CLI version: 0.0.4) <a href='https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/#installation'>Fastapi source page here</a>
* Docker <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/">find docker source here</a>

### Installing

* Clone this reposiroty into your local machine ( repo link https://github.com/kinyodan/shamiri-backend-api.git )
* CD into the cloned repository folder and then CD into the "/backend" folder
* Run below commands 

### Building the docker mage 

* While having docker installed in your machine (link shared above under dependecies)
* Step 1: To build the docker image Run
```
docker-compose build
```
* Step 2: Start the Docker Containers:
```
docker-compose up -d
```
* Step 3: Running Migrations:
   Create the migrations:
   ```
   docker-compose exec web alembic revision --autogenerate -m "init"
   ```
   Apply the Migration:
   ```
   docker-compose exec web alembic upgrade head
   ```
* If all is well the backend should be up and running on localhost <strong>( http://0.0.0.0:8000/ ) </strong>
   you can test it using api testng tools like <a href="https://www.postman.com/"> postman <a/> or any others to confirm all is well.

  NB: Remember to stop the running service for posgresql since its the databse used on the docker container
  
  ```
  sudo service postgresql stop
  ```

command on terminal while in the root folder of the application.
```
docker-compose run test 
```
The test tool used is Pytest 

But also after finishing all the Installation steps outlined above running 
```
docker-compose up 
```
will run the tests during application start up and you can see the test result output
